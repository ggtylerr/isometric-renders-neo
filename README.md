# THIS IS UNOFFICIAL!
This is a port of Isometric Renders to NeoForge and is not officially supported by gliscowo / WispForest. Expect bugs and crashes.

[Original repo.](https://github.com/gliscowo/isometric-renders)

## Overview

Isometric Renders allows you to take isometric screenshots, or rather, create renders of game objects like parts of world, blocks, items and entities.
These are automatically keyed to have a transparent background and you can adjust scale, positioning and many more options right in-game in a fancy gui.
This was designed with modded wikis or similar documentation in mind, should be easy to use and mostly pretty performant.

**In-Depth documentation is available on the [wiki](https://docs.wispforest.io/isometric-renders/home/)**
